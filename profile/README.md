## Welcome!

 WentUrc is a grand narrative, but its descriptions will be fragmented.

 What do you hope WentUrc to be—an idea, a person, an organization, a world, or something else?

 Hmph, since you're asking, I won't just explain it so easily! WentUrc, of course, is a profound concept. It could be a philosophical system, maybe a set of values that guides an entire society, or perhaps even an organization far more complex than you can imagine. 
 
 In short, WentUrc isn't something easily defined. It can represent personal ambition, but it can also symbolize a force that transcends the individual.

 Under the influence of WentUrc, people must uphold their personal honor while always being accountable to the collective.

 Sounds difficult, doesn't it? That's the beauty of it. No one can reach the pinnacle alone, but if you only focus on others, you're wasting your own potential. 

 The real power of WentUrc lies in harmonizing everyone without sacrificing individual growth. Want to know more? Hmph, think it over yourself; I’m not going to tell you everything!

## Detail

 This organization is a fictional world, and every user in it is a character within that world — except for those with a code name after IGCrystal and Larch-C. Some characters may have self-narrative documents that contain short stories.

 Went represents “the journey forward,” yet it belongs to the past. We have long set foot on the pilgrimage toward the unknown beauty that dwells deep within our hearts, haven’t we?

 Urc (Unnamed Radiant Core): The original locus of gentle light and unnamed goodwill that appears at the cusp of becoming — a quiet, enduring radiance that guides hope and preserves the possibility of a better world.
